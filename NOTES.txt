USING TWO REPOs:
1.   github.com/strangefishBEDROOM/pwfc-bootstrap1
2.   https://github.com/strangefish2000/pwfc-bootstrap1

I've setup an upstream from strangefish2000 to strangefishBEDROOM
(to do this see Evernote / git)

USE:
git remote add upstream < GITHUB_ACCOUNT_TO_BE_FORKED >
then, to update from changes made on other account:
git pull upstream master
